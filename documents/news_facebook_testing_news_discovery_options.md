## Facebook Testing News Discovery Options

#### Facebook is testing to see whether new ways to discover content can create value for users and publishers. Facebook’s VP of News Feed discussed the new ideas as well as how the company views video and its relationships with publishers in an interview.

Facebook is testing out new ways for users to discover news content, including grouping articles or videos by topic, Facebook’s VP of News Feed, Adam Mosseri said at The Information’s New York subscriber summit on Tuesday.

&emsp;&emsp;

Another idea, which would likely expand beyond news to other types of content, is a discovery tab within Facebook’s app that would surface new articles or videos from pages that users don’t already follow.
>另一个想法是增加一个发现模块。

&emsp;&emsp;

It would “help people learn about things they might love but don’t know about yet,” Mr. Mosseri said. For example, a snowboarder who may find information about surfing interesting, or a person in one country could find out about music popular in other countries. “In some ways that’s the whole promise of the internet,” Mr. Mosseri said.
>帮助用户发现他们可能喜欢但是尚未知道的东西。

&emsp;&emsp;

And allowing people to follow a topic could make it easier for users to, say, find out news on their favorite sports team, which wouldn’t necessarily originate from the team itself or any single news organization.

&emsp;&emsp;

Mr. Mosseri declined to say whether users would see a version of either idea this year. He said he would not advocate for priority within the app “until we can prove it’s valuable for people and publishers.” Within Facebook, there is often jockeying over real estate within the app.
>目前还不能证明这是有价值的，所以暂时不会上线。

Much of the discussion focused on Facebook’s relationship with publishers and the news media. Mr. Mosseri said that he expected video to continue to grow within News Feed, citing as one piece of evidence the explosion in amount of time spent on Facebook in India following a recent carrier price war that lowered internet costs.

&emsp;&emsp;

He said that Facebook was working on ways to identify how to rank longer versus shorter videos, depending on user behavior. Someone watching longer videos at the end of the day may be in more of a video-watching mood than someone at a bus stop who wants to watch a 30-second clip, for example, and could be referred more videos to watch. The company has also been working to develop metrics to rank live videos, which can’t be measured by metrics such as percentage of the video that’s been viewed.

&emsp;&emsp;

Mr. Mosseri also acknowledged that Facebook’s Instant Articles product wouldn’t work for all publishers, although the company was seeing growth of around 26% since the beginning of the year in the number of publishers that use it. “It’s a publisher-by-publisher decision,” he said, adding, “If you can make more on the mobile web, you should do that.”
