## Whats Next in the Business of News

News publications should take a leaf from the cable TV industry’s playbook and strike bundling deals, aggregating a few publications in one fee. Any subscription publication could be the aggregator.

And so, it shouldn’t be a surprise that I believe the next big trend in news business models will be drawn from history, albeit a far more recent period. And that’s **the history of the paid television industry and the cable bundle** .

When operators like Tele-Communications Inc. started building and buying delivery systems. They struck deals with a wide variety of channels and even invested in content companies whose programs they wanted to carry. The operators paid each network a cut of what they were worth to attract more subscribers—with startup networks sometimes paying the operator for carriage.

This model allowed TV networks like CNN or Fox to make money from a far broader group of customers than actually viewed them or would pay for them directly.

Think of these as casual fans who like a network’s shows but don’t want to watch them exclusively around the clock. More recently, some cable networks have wised up to the fact they should capture those customers willing to pay them directly too. Hence networks like HBO and Showtime are starting to offer over-the-top stand-alone subscriptions too.

Unlike the owners of cable channels, the news industry targeted its most passionate fans through direct subscriptions first.  But cable’s history tells us that the news companies could reach their casual fans too, in an economically advantageous way. The fact that more news publishers are charging for digital subscriptions means the bundling door is open to them as well.

Now, the only question is who is the aggregator.

It’s tempting to think it will again be the technology companies, analogous to the role the operators played in television. I have no doubt that Google, Apple, Facebook and others are exploring opportunities here. Almost two years ago, I argued that Apple should seize the opportunity.

But it’s increasingly clear it won’t be the tech companies. In the case of television, the cable operator is economically aligned with the network. Because operators charge customers a direct subscription fee, they can calculate what each network is worth to their bundle fairly and directly. If you want to get wonky, it’s called the marginal churn contribution. It is a measure of how many people would churn from the bundle without the additional content, and it is the key to the symbiotic business between the operators and the networks.

Why Tech Gets It Wrong

Tech companies can’t offer news publications this sort of direct—and fair—math. Their currency is ad revenue, and their way of luring content owners is to offer them a cut.

There are two reasons ad-sharing is inferior to the subscription fee model.

The first is that the tech companies have an unfair advantage over the publishers. They control which ads run where based on their ad algorithms. When they allow publishers to sell the space, they still determine how much and on what terms.

The second problem with the advertising revenue split is that these revenue shares don’t pay the bills for news companies. In the first half of last year, publishers surveyed by a media trade group DCN had, on average, $560,144 in revenue from Facebook and $482,788 from Twitter. Those sums aren’t going to get any publisher excited, particularly when they come with the cost of hiring people to manage the channel.

There is one tech company with a subscription business that could offer news publishers better math: Amazon with Prime. Prime is currently structured more like a loyalty program; where it has partnered with others, like the Washington Post, it generally offers discounts to members. But it wouldn’t be a big leap to expand the model to offering the content directly—at an increased price—without requiring users to sign up for another subscription. (Bezos, you have my email!)

If including a new sports publication in a bundle led to 10,000 more $10-a-month subscriptions, the bundling publisher should pay the sports publication the lifetime value of those new subscribers minus some profit it wanted to take. Or a publisher could use the additional content to upsell customers to a higher tier. More content will give existing publications more pricing power, allowing them to charge more. They could split the delta with the publisher they were bundling.

Many publishers will view “carriage” of other news publications as competitive. This has been far less of a problem in cable industry, where the operators weren’t competitive with the TV channels. And when they became competitive by buying content companies, regulators intervened.
