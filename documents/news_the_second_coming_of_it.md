## The Second Coming of IT
>第二波IT时代

#### The current wave of IT provides powerful tools to businesses while reducing the need for analysts and middle managers. But don’t expect these new applications to transform consumers’ lives anytime soon.
>这一波IT时代将为企业提供强大的工具来减少对分析师和中层管理者的需求。但是离这些新型应用进入C端用户生活，还早。

&emsp;&emsp;

For a generation before we thought of “technology companies” as Google and Facebook, there was a long era of IT, or “information technology.” During this era, technology was an unglamorous industry that made businesses more effective. Consumers didn’t touch it.
>在谷歌和Facebook之前，计算机行业处在一个较长的IT时代。在这个阶段，技术行业的目的是为企业提高效率，但是与C端用户没什么关系。

&emsp;&emsp;

I believe that machine learning and AI are bringing us to a second IT phase, where the most exciting developments will become powerful tools for businesses but, in most cases, little more than promise for consumers.
>作者认为机器学习和人工智能将带我们进入第二波IT时代。这个阶段行业内会发展出强大的企业工具，而不是面向消费者的产品。

&emsp;&emsp;

Someday the wheel will turn again and we will enter a second pure technology era where breakthrough new consumer services will emerge. But we need to walk before we run—and walking means an era of IT before we get to the next wave of what we have come to know as tech.
>之后某个时候，我们可能会进入第二个纯技术时代，涌现出颠覆性的消费者基本产品服务。但是我们首先需要经历IT时代。

&emsp;&emsp;

The tools for managing data now available to businesses have improved at a staggering pace.
>目前，数据管理工具正在以惊人的速度发展着。

&emsp;&emsp;

**Amazon’s Redshift for data storage, visualization tools like Periscope, and machine learning toolkits like Google’s TensorFlow** allow businesses—even small ones—to store, analyze and make decisions that weren’t possible before without massive capital investment. Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce are in an all-out, multi-front war to **help businesses optimize themselves in amazing ways.**
>数据存储工具如亚马逊的Redshift，可视化工具如Periscope，机器学习工具如谷歌的TensorFlow，使得小型企业不需要大量的成本投入下，也可以实现数据的存储、分析和决策。互联网公司们都在努力帮助企业去做优化。

&emsp;&emsp;

Ten years ago, I worked for a major credit card company on a consulting project analyzing millions of rows of credit card data. The tools we had then versus the tools that are widely available now are night and day. Today, I can do the same type of analysis my old consulting firm charged hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars for in just a few moments.
>之前做数据分析非常复杂费力。如今，同样的数据分析工作可以通过简单的几步完成。

&emsp;&emsp;

This isn’t a new story. Companies have been telling versions of this narrative of displacement around everything from medicine to finance for a generation. But in 2017, these tools are available and having practical impact to an unprecedented degree.
>之前所有公司也都在讨论在财经和医药领域技术对人力的替代。但是在2017年，这些工具正在成为现实，产生实际的影响。

&emsp;&emsp;

### Waiting for Prime Time
If you had waited with bated breath for pure direct-to-consumer technology companies at the beginning of the first IT wave, you would have turned blue long before you were ultimately vindicated. I am pretty certain we find ourselves once again in the same position.
>在IT时代期待C级产品是会令人失望的。在第二波IT时代也一样。

&emsp;&emsp;

Cars are perhaps the most obvious example. Technology in cars will soon be able to drive us—in some conditions—from point A to B and help keep us safer. The coupling of man and machine is great. But I would strongly argue we are still eons away from cars reliably and consistently driving themselves without human operators. There are entire areas ranging from pedestrian judgment and fleet management that are still no more than theoretical exercises.
>以汽车举个例子。汽车技术很快就使得人们具备从一个地方快速到达另一个地方的能力。专业司机和汽车成为一个良好的组合。但是如果要将这项能力提供给所有的C端用户，对于那些不会开车的人，目前技术是做不到的。

&emsp;&emsp;

Cars are just one example. Voice recognition is mildly passable most of the time. Some of the translation work Google is doing is impressive. Recently I have been blown away by some of the simple but powerful applications taking hold in Google Photos. And, it is impressive that cars on the highway can drive themselves in certain situations.
>汽车只是一个例子。虽然汽车也语音识别等技术现在正在往C端发展。谷歌翻译的已经可以做很多很好的翻译了。汽车也在往无人驾驶发展。

&emsp;&emsp;

But the reality is that none of these applications transform consumers’ experience. Most are, for now, parlor tricks and slight improvements.
>但实际上，这些应用都还没能成为成熟的C端产品。大部分只是在原有基础上做了些微小优化。

&emsp;&emsp;

There is nothing wrong with this. It is necessary and good for people to be working on these things. But we need to recognize that tools good enough to couple with human managers and operators aren’t necessarily good enough to directly interface with users.
>我们需要知道，可以令专业操作者使用良好的工具，并不足够优秀到可以使普通消费者良好使用。

&emsp;&emsp;

It is one thing for businesses to get leverage in decision-making through access to data, compute and good algorithms. It is quite another for those technologies to be fully developed enough to enter prime-time consumer use.
>通过数据、计算、算法为商业决策提供帮助是一回事。使技术成熟到可以让C端用户使用，是另一回事。

&emsp;&emsp;

The current IT wave is going to have implications for which jobs technology displaces as well as which businesses will become most valuable. Just as computers eliminated jobs like telephone operators and typists, this wave of IT is going to eliminate white-collar analysts and middle manager jobs.
>目前的IT时代将预示哪些职位被消除，同时哪些业务会变得更有价值。就如计算机消除了电话接线员和专业打字员的工作，这波IT时代也意味着分析师和中层管理部分的消除。

&emsp;&emsp;

The reason analyst jobs vanish should be pretty clear. A single analyst empowered with an enormous amount of data and huge amounts of compute can do the work of many less-empowered people. I feel very directly the efficiency gain in the businesses I have operated in over the last several years. You don’t need as many people working to get the same (or better) answers.
>分析师的工作慢慢消失的原因很直观。如果单个分析师被赋予了强大的数据和分析工具的支持，他可以比没有这些工具的人做多得多的事情。之后你会发现，其实你不需要那么多分析师来做分析工作了。

&emsp;&emsp;

Less obviously, you also need far fewer middle managers. As companies get better metric-ed and more collaborative, machines and data can take care of the performance tracking and improvement functions middle managers performed. You still need people to coach and develop, but you just don’t need as many middle managers to execute some tasks as you once did.
>不那么直观的层面，你会需要更少的中层管理者。随着公司更善于收集指标和协作，机器和数据可以代替人力去做绩效的跟踪和优化，而这些之前都是中层管理者做的。仍然需要人去做培训和业务拓展，只是不需要那么多人去做管理了。

&emsp;&emsp;

Moreover, with huge amounts of data and compute at command, the difference between good and great analysts and managers will become even starker, stoking competition. The best will do better, the rest will struggle.
>当有了大量的数据和工具在手之后，一个好的分析师或经理，与一个顶尖的分析师或经理，他们直接的差别会更严峻，竞争更激烈。顶尖的分析师会做的更好，其余的会为生存挣扎。

&emsp;&emsp;

The impact of this wave of IT on the white-collar workforce will likely come more swiftly and dramatically than it will for the millions of professional drivers trying to figure out when their jobs will be replaced by self-driving cars. The white-collar displacement is happening now.
>第二波IT时代对职位的影响，会比互联网软件对出租车司机的影响，来的更快更戏剧化。对白领的影响已经在发生了。

&emsp;&emsp;

### Fewer Windfalls

The new wave of IT will also shift tech valuations. Plenty of big and valuable businesses were built in the last IT era, including IBM and Oracle. But they were far less valuable than the pure direct-to-consumer technology plays like Apple, Google and Facebook.
>企业级服务提供商如IBM、甲骨文的估值，会比C端服务企业的公司如苹果、谷歌、Facebook，要低一些。

&emsp;&emsp;

The reason for this comes down to a few key facts. First, businesses tend to have more negotiating power than consumers. In an IT era, technology companies sell to other businesses, which usually have more negotiating power against them than consumers. That means that, ultimately, it is harder to extract a ton of value out of them. That is why the biggest consumer technology companies are an order of magnitude bigger than the SaaS businesses.
>原因有几个。第一，企业有更强的谈判和议价能力。所以企业级服务比较难抽取巨大的利润。C端用户的利润更好赚些。

&emsp;&emsp;

The other factor is that IT has trouble maintaining as much differentiation as pure consumer tech. Data or IP advantages are hard to sustain long-term. Amazon Web Services has a staggering lead, but it is possible to compel companies to move to the Google or IBM or Microsoft clouds. A good company working hard can usually replicate most of what another company offers in a B2B setting.
>另一个原因是企业级服务比较难建立壁垒，容易被更努力的公司替代。

&emsp;&emsp;

Not so with pure technology, where the return on scale is greater. Part of this has to do with the fact that businesses usually own their own data and plug into technology for just the technology. Consumer tech companies are better able to use access to data as a competitive advantage.
>而C端技术公司，可以通过独家的用户数据，建立优势。

&emsp;&emsp;

The upshot here is that I expect big advances, but the financial windfalls for the current new technology companies will be smaller for a period than they have been in the last decade.
>所以作者预测，目前的技术公司会有很大的发展前景，但是营收不会有出乎意料的大增长。

&emsp;&emsp;

There is a lot to be optimistic about around this next IT wave. Companies are going to get more efficient and more profitable by using technology well. Pricing, advertising targeting, balancing elements of supply and demand and all the things that lots of data and processing can offer are going to provide wins. Traditional companies will also get leaner and more efficient.
>在这个时代，企业会通过合理地使用技术变得更高效更有利可图。定价，广告定向，供求的平衡都需要大量的数据和分析来取得胜利。传统公司也将从中受益。

&emsp;&emsp;


But employees and companies will face big challenges in this IT age. Until we get to the next pure tech era, employees will see more competition for fewer jobs. While technology companies will benefit from the growth, they won’t garner the power or financial upside they had in the last direct-to-consumer age.
>但是职员和公司会面临很大的挑战。在我们到达下一个纯技术时代前，职员会面临更多的竞争和更少的职位。技术公司会有更大的发展，但是营收不会有惊人的增长。
