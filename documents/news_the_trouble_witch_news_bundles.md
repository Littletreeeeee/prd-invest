## The Trouble With News Bundles

An all-access pass could indeed be better for consumers and make for a more elegant web experience. And it isn’t going to happen.

Given the minimal marginal costs of serving content, a bundle makes a lot of sense. It offers the consumer better value and the publisher makes more money. But there is a big wrinkle in the formula: Until the volume of subscribers in the bundle is great enough to offset the reduction in average revenue per user, the bundle is a bad deal for publishers.

Scroll CEO Tony Haile argues that the best way to put together a subscription bundle of news content is to guarantee readers an ad-free “experience” across a range of premium sites without access to all the content. That would eliminate the problem of slow-to-load pages. And it wouldn’t cannibalize single-site subscriptions.

Consider the following example: The Erewhon Times has 1 million subscribers paying $10/month, generating annual revenue of $120 million. Our hypothetical Newsbundle has 11 million subscribers paying for unrestricted access across a network and guarantees a payment to the Erewhon Times of $1/month a subscriber, for annual revenue of $132 million.

What would happen if publishers came together and reframed their bundle thinking around experience rather than access? A publishers’ bundle guaranteeing a fast, ad-free experience across a wide range of premium sites would be cheap (you only have to beat ad ARPUs, not subscription ARPUs) and valuable to casual fans. The bundle wouldn’t provide an all-access pass because the vast majority of users wouldn’t consume enough content to hit the paywall. As a result, the bundle would avoid cannibalizing single-site subscriptions.

This funnel pragmatically aligns value at the casual fan and super fan level, while pushing publishers to serve consumers by creating great experiences and driving loyalty. It shows a future of news worth fighting for.
