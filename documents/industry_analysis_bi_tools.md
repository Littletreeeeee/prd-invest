# Business Intelligence software
>商业智能软件

Business Intelligence Software (or BI software) is a class of computer applications that process and analyze corporate data to produce quality insights, and help understand the health of your business. BI software uses a variety of formulas and metrics to measure, compare, and relate business indicators, and makes it possible to distinguish the strengths and weaknesses of every company. The main functions of these systems are data discovery, data management, and reporting, but some of them also evaluate functionality and employees’ performance.
>处理分析企业数据，转化为洞察，帮助明白业务是否健康。BI软件使用多样的方法和维度去测量、对比、管理商业指标，从而判断每个公司的优势和劣势。主要功能包括：发现数据、管理数据、和数据报告，还有些产品会衡量功能性和员工绩效。

The goal of business intelligence programs is to allow for the easy and deeper interpretation of large volumes of business data. Finding out opportunities to grow and adopting effective strategies based on these deep, analytical insights can provide businesses a huge competitive market edge over competitors, aside from long-term stability.

## Targeted Businesses
**Departmental buyers and business users:** These buyers opt for small data-discovery apps and BI tools over big BI systems. They look for ease-of-use and fast deployment, and do not worry much about robust functionality and integration. These are normally business users and not IT staff.

**IT buyers:** These are traditional buyers who look for in-depth functionality and integration with the other business apps they use. For these buyers, integration across different units and entities is more vital than ease of use.

## Type of Business Intelligence Software

Business intelligence programs can be deployed in different ways. These include:

* On-premise deployment: In-house product installation using equipment owned or leased by the company. The advantage is you are assured of data security.

* Cloud implementation: Public cloud, private cloud, or a hybrid cloud. The benefits are you don’t have to download any software, or worry about upgrades and maintenance.

* Data Management Tools
Include the following features:

  * Data quality management –  Helps companies maintain clean, error-free, and standardized data. Standardization is essential for BI implementations that include data from multiple sources.
  * Extract, transform and load (ETL) – Gathers data from outside sources, changes it, and then loads it into the target system (a warehouse or database).

* Data Discovery Applications
List of features includes:

  * Data mining – Sifts through vast amounts of data to identify new patterns.
  * Online analytical processing (OLAP) – Enables users to speedily evaluate multidimensional data from various perspectives.
  * Predictive analytics – Evaluates current and historical data to make forecasts about future opportunities and risks.
  * Semantic and text analytics – Extracts and interprets huge volumes of text to spot patterns, sentiment, and relationships.

* Reporting Tools
Features include:

  * Visualizations – Helps users create sophisticated graphical representations of data using simple user interfaces.
  * Dashboards – Dashboards highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) that help managers focus on important metrics.
  * Report writers – Allows users to design and create custom reports.
  * Scorecarding – Scorecards give a numerical weight to performance and help to map progress towards objectives.

## Key Features of Business Intelligence Software

The most typical features of a business intelligence program include:

* Experimenting to look at previous decisions (A/B testing or multivariate testing)
* Forecasting future business results (predictive modeling or predictive analytics)
* Extrapolating business data to see new patterns and relationships (data mining)
* Explaining the causes why a result or outcome has happened (statistical analysis or quantitative analysis)

### Data Management
A major consideration when selecting business intelligence programs is to check how capable a tool is in giving complex business data relevant meaning and context for your business to understand the entire situation. It means the tool you should choose should be able to make the raw and unstructured business data “analytic-ready” with its data manipulation, extraction, query, as well as business logic features.

### Reporting
When choosing business intelligence, check out their reporting features as claimed by the solution’s vendor or provider. Can the tool really create and distribute business data in visually informative charts, tables, and in a specified or desired page layout. Can the tool also provide you with not just fundamental reporting but even advanced and more meaningful reporting and presentation features?

Features such as associative relationship displays, three dimensional images, and pivot-like, easy-to-configure interfaces should be some of the top considerations in your mind. Do these features show up on a mobile platform, particularly when you are showing these data outside your work?

### Architecture
Does the business intelligence tool support scalable methods for diverse and complex data sets? For instance, if your business has a huge number of data sets that are at the same time complicated, you might consider buying a program that can effectively handle them and scales to large numbers of data sets.

Check if the tool is designed using a single code base or if it offers solutions compiled from various products that are developed independently. Check if the tool has a quick development cycle, provides your business tightly integrated solutions, and offers amazing user experience.

Can the tool be embedded with the information technology systems you are already using? Does it provide you with solid data security? Can the tool restrict business data view and functionality to a select number of users or user groups?

Does the tool provide you with consistent data backups? If it isn’t, then your business data might get leaked or lost when serious technical glitches happen.

## Benefits of BI Software
### Ability to integrate information from different business systems
Strategic business insight generally needs data across various systems. For example, operational results of your company will need a financial perspective. Therefore, your business intelligence software solution should have the capacity to quickly and dynamically integrate information from different sources so you will get answers to a number of business questions.

### Outstanding reporting and analysis
When looking at programs, always remember that the solution should offer you more knowledge about complex trends and views in your company. Do not stick with a business intelligence software application that can merely report the business data it mined. You should look for a tool that offers you an explorable capacity, letting you to understand different actions or strategies you can take to predict different scenarios and look for the best ways to achieve success.

### Historical analysis and reporting
Ideally, the business intelligence program you should invest in is one that will be able to give you a deeper insight into the company’s overall performance over time and the causes for that positive (or negative) performance. Successful decision-making, in general, needs to have a thorough and critical understanding of the growth of your company over the years and the reasons behind it. In short, your program should have the capacity to map and analyze historical data that may be complex over time, even years. This means you should also get a tool that has the capacity to extract, manipulate, and understand possibly a lot of information. In a lot of companies, millions of database entries are a normal thing.

### Future projection and forecasting
The tool’s capacity to analyze and report historical data enables you to project business findings into the future. It will enable you to look at present opportunities and forecast the next possible steps for your company. The ability to forecast and project scenarios in the future should always be among your top factors when it comes to success.

### Comments:

Periscope helps to generate or create visual chart and graphs for presentation to the sales team. You do not have to be an expert programmer to make the best use of this tool. You can learn how to code using the learning sessions and free tutorials at your disposal. The idea is to be able to customize those graphs and charts such that you get the results you need and it becomes easy when you are presenting the results. Also, you can export files from excel spreadsheets so that you can analyze them and present them into a report in the form of graphs or charts for easy understanding.

For those who have little or no knowledge in programming, the learning curve is real. It will take you a long time to figure out some of the features and how they are utilized to give you the results or experience you want. The user interface can be complex when you are getting started but you figure it out with time. There is a security protocol which you have to follow once you generate your chart, which entails locking them. If you do not undertake this procedure, anyone can tamper with your charts. You thus have to figure out how to lock them and, at first, I could not hack this.

Since I deal with procurement and supply chain management, I need to know which product is doing better and the one which is not up to standard. With this tool, I am able to achieve this with ease. I can view the sales pattern and how a specific product is responding to the market and decide on the best way forward. For example, if a product is performing better, I know that I am doing something right. However, if a product is not doing well, I can put more attention to get it back on track. On top of that, I can help out other group members by providing them with charts so that they can keep track of the key performance indicators for better decision making.
